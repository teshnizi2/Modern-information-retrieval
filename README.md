It was our project in the Modern Information Retrieval course at the Sharif University of Technology. It's in three phases.

### Sample of The UI

The implemented UI in the third phase for the first phase's search engine is as below:

### Explanations
---
The explanation of each phase and its implemented parts is as below:
#### Phase 1
In this phase, we implemented the base information retrieval algorithms. The algorithms are `ltn.lnn`, `ltc.lnc`, and `okapi25`. We also implemented some compressions types (`Gamma Code` and `Variable Byte Code`). At last, we evaluate our algorithms' implementations.
#### Phase 2
In this phase, we implemented Naive Bayse classification, classification with neural networks, classification with language models, and transformer-based classification. We also enhanced our search engine. There are some evaluations for the classifications, too.
#### Phase 3
In this phase, first, we implemented a crawler for [semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org) website. Then we implemented a personalized PageRank algorithm and by using it, we create a personalized search. After that, we ranked the authors of our crawled papers. The next part is a recommender system with collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms and their evaluations. At last, we create a beautiful UI which name is `Amoogle` (a combination of Amir Mohammad and Google) for the search engine in the first phase.
### How to Run
---
#### Phase 3
It's a React project. Run the below commands respectively:
- First, run the last 6 cells of the `Pahse 3/ir-phase-3.ipynb` file. It's somehow the backend of the UI.
- Then run `npm install` in the `Pahse 3/search_engin_ui` directory.
- At last `npm start` in the `Pahse 3/search_engin_ui` directory.
